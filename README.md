# Path: quickly add/remove directory to Path on Windows

Usage:

```sh
path           # Add current directory to Path
path c:/...    # Add a different directory to Path
path -r        # Remove current directory from Path
path -r c:/... # Remove a different directory from Path
```

*Note: this modifies the user path, not the system path.*
